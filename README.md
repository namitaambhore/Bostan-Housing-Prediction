# Bostan-Housing-Prediction

Bostan Housing Data Analysis
Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the Bostan Housing Data, a dataset containing information about residential properties in the Bostan area, including features such as location, property size, number of rooms, and more. The aim of this analysis is to uncover insights about the real estate market, understand key factors driving housing prices, and develop predictive models to estimate property values.

Key Objectives:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and deal with outliers.
Convert categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood, property type) into numerical values using encoding techniques (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
Normalize continuous variables (e.g., square footage, price) to ensure models run efficiently.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of key features like price, property age, and size.
Analyze correlations between different features (e.g., how property size affects price).
Create heatmaps and pair plots to identify relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:

Generate new features such as property age (current year - year built) and price per square meter.
Explore geographical features (e.g., proximity to schools, parks, or transportation hubs) that might impact property value.
Predictive Modeling:

Use machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict housing prices based on historical data.
Tune hyperparameters for model optimization using techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
Compare the performance of different algorithms to identify the most effective model for price prediction.
Technologies and Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Tools:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, Mean Absolute Error, RMSE, R² score
Geospatial Analysis (Optional): Folium, GeoPandas (if geographic data is included)
Key Findings & Insights:

Price Trends: Understand the price trends in the Bostan area over time, and identify factors like neighborhood development or proximity to amenities that may influence property values.
Price Drivers: Identify the most influential features affecting housing prices, such as property size, age, and location.
Market Segmentation: Group properties into categories based on price, size, or other factors to better understand the market segments in Bostan.
Impact:

This project can provide valuable insights to both homebuyers and investors by highlighting what drives housing prices in the Bostan area. Additionally, the predictive model can help potential buyers estimate the value of properties before making purchasing decisions. The analysis can also inform real estate developers and local governments on how certain factors (e.g., new infrastructure) may influence housing prices in the future.

Future Improvements:

Time Series Forecasting: Implement time-series analysis to predict future housing prices based on historical trends.
Incorporate External Data: Enhance the model by adding external data such as economic indicators, interest rates, or population growth projections to improve accuracy.
Advanced Algorithms: Explore more advanced machine learning techniques like neural networks or ensemble models to further improve prediction accuracy.
